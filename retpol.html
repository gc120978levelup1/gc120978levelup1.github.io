              <i><b>Return Policy</b></i>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your
              purchase, unfortunately we can’t offer you a refund or exchange.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused and in the
              same condition that you received it. It must also be in the
              original packaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              For information about products that can't be returned, see Items
              that Can't be Returned.

            <p>
              To determine if a product sold by myStore has a longer return
              timeline, locate the product type below.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the product type isn't listed or doesn't state another returns
              time frame, our standard 30-day return policy applies.
            </p>
            <p>
              While most sellers offer a returns policy equivalent to myStore s,
              some seller returns policies may vary.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the seller's listing is eligible for myStore Prime, it will be
              subject to the same return policies as items fulfilled by myStore
              com that are outlined on this page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an
              email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We
              will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you return an item, your refund amount and refund method may
              vary. Check the payment method refunded and the status of your
              refund in Your Orders.
            </p>
            <p>
              When returning an item, you have the option to choose your
              preferred refund method in the Online Returns Center. After the
              carrier receives your item, it can take up to two weeks for us to
              receive and process your return.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain items can take up to 30 days. We typically process returns
              within 3-5 business days after the carrier delivers the item to
              our Returns Center. When we complete processing your return, we
              issue a refund to the selected payment method. Learn how to Track
              Your Return.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to use your refund without waiting for us to process
              your return, you can select the Instant Refund option, if
              available. Instant refunds are either refunded to your credit card
              or issued as an myStore.com Gift Card balance. You'll still need
              to return your items within 30 days.

            <p>
              If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank
              account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take
              some time before your refund is officially posted.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your

            <p>
              The type of refund or credit a gift recipient receives depends on
              how the giver purchased the gift and how the recipient returns the
              gift. For more information, go to Return a Gift. myStore may
              determine that a gift recipient is eligible for a refund without
              requiring a return. If a gift return is eligible for a refund
              without returning the item, the gift recipient receives a
              notification in the Returns Center or via Customer Service. For
              more information, go to Conditions of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a
              credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or
              original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

              items cannot be refunded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sale Items are sold at a loss of profit and out of stock inventories. Therefore merchantile wise it is not necessary to refund the item.
