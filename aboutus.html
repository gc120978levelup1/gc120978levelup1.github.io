              <h2>Customer Obsession</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work
                vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay
                attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
              </p>
              <h2>Ownership</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice
                long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of
                the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say
                “that’s not my job.”
              </p>
              <h2>Invent and Simplify</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their
                teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally
                aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited
                by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we
                may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
              </p>
              <h2>Are Right, A Lot</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good
                instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm
                their beliefs.
              </p>
              <h2>Learn and Be Curious</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve
                themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to
                explore them.
              </p>
              <h2>Hire and Develop the Best</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.
                They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them
                throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take
                seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of
                our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career
                Choice.
              </p>
              <h2>Insist on the Highest Standards</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think
                these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually
                raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality
                products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects
                do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so
                they stay fixed.
              </p>
              <h2>Think Big</h2>
              <p>
                Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and
                communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think
                differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
              </p>
              <h2>Bias for Action</h2>
              <p>
                Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are
                reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated
                risk taking.
              </p>
              <h2>Frugality</h2>
              <p>
                Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness,
                self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for
                growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.
              </p>
              <h2>Earn Trust</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others
                respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so
                is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or
                their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark
                themselves and their teams against the best.
              </p>
              <h2>Dive Deep</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details,
                audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote
                differ. No task is beneath them.
              </p>
              <h2>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when
                they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or
                exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do
                not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision
                is determined, they commit wholly.
              </p>
              <h2>Deliver Results</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver
                them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite
                setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
              </p>
              <h2>Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer</h2>
              <p>
                Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive,
                higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.
                They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for
                others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow
                employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s
                next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their
                employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or
                elsewhere.
              </p>
              <h2>Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility</h2>
              <p>
                We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big,
                we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be
                humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our
                actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations
                need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a
                determination to make better, do better, and be better for our
                customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large.
                And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow.
                Leaders create more than they consume and always
